            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p>Many people and services on the internet will tell you that finding a job is a known procedure that applies to everyone:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scour the job boards for postings titled: [the position you want]</li>
                        <li>Send your resume and standard cover letter to as many options as you can</li>
                        <li>Wait to hear back about an interview</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I don't disagree that by playing this numbers game you are likely to get a job. I do question whether it is the job you
                    truly want.</p>
                    <p>This form of shallow decision-making is common in the current world of large amounts of choices and fast-paced life. The
                    popular internet services often remove the need for analysis. When we look for something online we type a question, hit
                    enter and let the highest-ranking result be our final decision. We have forgotten the importance of being discerning and
                    thinking critically.</p>
                    <p>Applying to jobs without being selective will cause a lot of disappointment when you end up in a position that doesn't
                    match your expectations or aspirations.</p>
                    <p>Just like job postings include a list of requirements they expect of you, so should you generate a collection of the things that you want and don't want in a job. Since this is such a personal thing, it involves a bit of self-examination. I will merely try to give structure to your journey.</p>
                    <p>It helps to separate the aspects of a job into categories:</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-3 post-subheading">The Subject</h3>
                    <img class="pb-5 img-fluid" src="img/subject-img.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Answering these questions can help you discover if you are really interested in the subject.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What problem is the company trying to solve? Is that important to you?</li>
                        <li>When you researched the subject, did you find yourself clicking on links to related articles or were you eager to finish
                        and move on?</li>
                        <li>If you were to get the job, and a friend asked you about it, could you explain it in a genuinely positive tone?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">The 'What Will You be Doing' Part</h3>
                    <p>Don’t skim through the 'what you will be doing' part of the job posting. It often is a snapshot of what your day would
                    be like at that job.</p>
                    <p>It won't always be straightforward. Try to read between the lines to boil down the main activities you will be doing,
                    for example:</p>

                    <p>For an agile project management role:</p>
                    <p><i>You will facilitate communication between teams</i></p>
                    <p>You could deduce that it will be your responsibility to make sure teams are setting up the right meetings like stand-ups
                    and retrospectives.</p>
                   

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Interpersonal Stuff</h3>
                    <img class="pb-5 img-fluid" src="img/interpersonal.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Use your past experiences as evidence to define what you like and dislike when it comes to working with people.</p>
                    <p>Consider your last job and answer these questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What do you think you were good at when you worked in a team?</li>
                        <li>What would your teammates say you were good at?</li>
                        <li>What have you not enjoyed when working with people?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thinking about previous experiences can help bring to light what your values are. You can use your list of values to
                    compare against the part of job descriptions that define what they expect of you. They are often called: 'About you' or
                    'Who you are'.</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Learning and Growing</h3>
                    <p>While job hunting, you might narrow your focus to just getting a job. But having just that goal in mind overlooks the
                    fact that you probably also have other aspirations like improving your knowledge on a subject and acquiring new skills
                    in an area.</p>
                    <p>You must consider a job that will allow you to grow in the direction that you want. Determine if the day to day
                    activities will help you improve the skills you want to gain.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, consider what the company is doing to promote ongoing learning. This usually comes in the form of paid
                    conferences, paid online workshops and connections to groups in the community.</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Schedules</h3>
                    <p>Companies are realizing the importance of work-life balance. Find a job in a company that offers opportunities to work
                    in a schedule that matches your life needs.</p>
                    <p>Think about the parts of your current schedule that are important to you. What habits have you formed that help you be
                    more productive? Consider jobs that would respect those routines and activities.</p>
                    <p>Some important things to consider are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How flexible are the working hours?</li>
                        <li>What will be the commute time? Would you prefer a shorter commute to save time for other activities or could you
                        positively use that time, for example, to read or listen to podcasts?</li>
                        <li>How much overtime will you have to do? How will you be compensated for it?</li>
                        <li>What are the vacation policies?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">The Pay</h3>
                    <img class="pb-5 img-fluid" src="img/pay.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Realistically assess your financial needs so you aim for a job that allows you to cover your expenses as well as save
                    some money for future projects.</p>
                    <p>Some useful practices you can do to better understand your financial needs are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Look up average pay for the position you are going for. Use different sources to get a better idea. Compare that against
                        the salary in the job postings.</li>
                        <li>Look back through your bank statement, or consider an expense tracker to get a better sense of whether you will be able
                        to cover your recurring expenses.
                        </li>
                        <li>Consider how much you will be able to save after expenses.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Finding the right job can feel like a full-time job. However, you can comfort yourself by recognizing that you are
                    practicing important skills that will be useful for any position. These include critical thinking, analytical thinking,
                    organizational skills and perseverance. Additionally, you will be learning more about yourself and better defining the things that are important in your life.</p>

                    <p>Don’t waste your time applying to jobs you will not be content with, be selective and deliberate. No one can tell you
                    what job suits you best, it's up to you to discover it.</p>
