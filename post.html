                    <p>Figuring out what to do for most of the hours in your day seems like an easy task. Find an opening, get a job, get paid.
                    You can do that a few times and fail at the interview or quit shortly after taking the job because eventually, something
                    you didn’t consider will come up, leaving you at the same starting point, only this time with a longer list of
                    requirements or things to avoid. So you might as well start by clearly defining what you want in a job.</p>
                    <p>Just like job postings include a list of requirements they expect of you, so should you keep a collection of the things
                    that you want in a job. Spend just as much time learning about the employer, as you spend learning about yourself.</p>

                    <p>It helps to separate concerns by categories:</p>

                    <h3 class="pt-3 post-subheading">The Subject</h3>
                    <img class="pb-5 img-fluid" src="img/subject-img.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>What problem is the company trying to solve? Can you get behind that?</li>
                        <li>If you don’t know a lot about the subject, do some research on it, figure out if it is
                            something that catches your
                            interest. Did you find yourself clicking on links to other articles about related matters?
                            Can you relate your own life
                            experiences to what you read? Did you afterward daydream about other solutions within that
                            topic, or how the company
                            could improve or do things differently?</li>
                        <li>If you were to get the job and someone who knows you well were to ask you where you work,
                            could you explain it, and
                            say it in a genuinely positive tone?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">The Actual Operations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don’t skim through the <i>‘what you will be doing’</i> part of the job posting. Take it
                            seriously. They will often include
                            statements with lists of items, for instance <i>‘Views OOP, MVC, and version control as
                                essential to building good
                                software’</i>. Don’t be okay with knowing 80% of each statement. If you are less than
                            99% sure about one of the items, go
                            research it, understand how to use it, be able to define it in your own words, out loud.
                            Yes, talk to yourself out loud.</li>
                        <li>If you expect to write and send your application the same day you are missing the point.
                            Preparation requires time, be
                            patient. Go write a throwaway piece of code for every few points in the list of ‘what you
                            will be doing’. For instance,
                            you may think, <i>'I work on my own, and haven’t had much need for version control, but I
                                know how it works'</i>. That's not
                            good enough. Start a repository for a practice project, commit your changes, create feature
                            branches, try to get
                            yourself in a git pickle. Resolve your problems, resolve yourself.</li>
                        <li>Every day that you are working towards the application, read a few articles before starting.
                            It will expose you to
                            different ideas, it will help expand your vocabulary and improve your writing skills. As a
                            bonus, you will be </i>‘staying
                            up-to-date on best practices, and new tech’</i>, a requirement almost every job posting
                            includes. <br><mark>Side tip:</mark> set a time limit
                            to this exercise as it can become a great procrastinating activity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Interpersonal Stuff</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/interpersonal.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don’t be self-deceptive. Go with the hard facts and evidence, instead of imagining what you
                            could, or would like to be
                            like. Take a walk on the retrospective side. What in the past have you been successful at
                            when it comes to working with
                            people? What have you not enjoyed or has soured things when working with people? Make two
                            lists that complete the
                            sentences: I liked when ____ and I didn’t like when ____. Be analytical and draw conclusions
                            from those. For instance,
                            I could have the following items:
                            <div class="post-sublist">
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I didn’t like when my boss would stand behind me and I had to explain on the
                                        spot what I was doing.</li>
                                    <li>I did not like not knowing who I could ask for help.</li>
                                    <li>I did like having scheduled weekly check-ups on progress on specific tasks.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>
                            From these, I could conclude that I like having a structure where it is clear when and to
                            whom I have to report
                            progress, and who I can ask for help. Recognizing these things will help you describe your
                            expectations during
                            interviews, which is an important part of finding the right job for you.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Learning and Styles</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a job interview, you should be prepared to answer a lot of questions, but you should also
                            come prepared with
                            questions for your employer. Don’t forget that this is how you determine whether you will be
                            able to be happy or
                            satisfied for most of the hours of most of the days in the week. Make sure that some of
                            those questions include asking
                            the employer how she supports continuous learning because let’s face it, programming is a
                            life-long learning journey.</li>
                        <li>Find out what is your learning style or styles. If you don’t know what that means, read
                            something about it. Or play
                            this fun game that helps with memory. Try to guess what it means, write it down, then look
                            it up and compare answers and
                            see how far from the truth you were.</li>
                        <li>A lot of companies do (if not, run away, they should) set aside time, money and or resources
                            for learning. These can
                            be in the form of time during work hours to further your learning by working on your own
                            stuff, paid conferences, access
                            to online classes and tutorials, or connections with groups in the community to do
                            volunteering work, meetups, Ted
                            talks, etc.</li>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/learn.jpg" alt="">
                        <li>A very important question to ask is how the company’s onboarding process works. I can’t
                            think of a worse experience
                            than being thrown into a project with no introduction, and with expectations of producing at
                            the same rate as people who
                            have worked there for years. It is important that the employer understands there has to be a
                            period at the beginning
                            where you will be going at slug-pace, while you are understanding the inner workings of the
                            project. During this time
                            you should have the necessary resources and support to guide you. Ask about it.</li>
                        <li>Remember, continuous learning will keep you motivated, engaged, and dynamic, as opposed to
                            bored, apathetic and
                            narrow-minded.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">Schedules</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Another area of potential self-deception. Smarten up! Wake up that brutal realism in you.
                        </li>
                        <li>What are parts of your day to day that are important to you? What can’t you live without?
                            Don’t undervalue them,
                            however trivial they may sound. For me that could be, walking the dog two or three times,
                            exercising, cooking dinner.</li>
                        <li>Now think of the things you want to accomplish for yourself outside of work. If you don’t
                            have any, <a
                                href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-side-projects-are-so-damn-important-239ba37209e"
                                target="#">read this</a>. Now try
                            to see when you could find time to do those things. Night classes, weekend sessions, early
                            mornings. You might think
                            mostly in money terms, but time is another form of currency, and similarly, it’s all about
                            budgeting.</li>
                        <li>When looking at job openings, find out what their time expectations are. Is it a 9-5 strict
                            schedule? Could you come
                            into work earlier, or later, or maybe work more hours fewer days? Will you have to work
                            overtime? What are the overtime
                            policies, justified overtime when you have to finish work before a deadline is never as bad
                            as obligatory overtime when
                            you’re just sitting waiting for work to be handed to you.</li>
                        <li>What is their vacation policy? Will you have enough time to do the things you like doing,
                            visiting family, traveling
                            the world, building a house, dream big, it’s important.</li>
                        <li>An important element, often overlooked, is the commute time. If it takes you an hour to get
                            there and an hour to
                            return that is an extra two hours less that you have to work on your side projects, exercise
                            and or life things. But
                            consider making the commute one of those things, and it might just make sense. If you can
                            and like to, you could bike, skate or run to work, bam! That’s your daily exercise. If your
                            office is pet-friendly, you could walk the dog to work and
                            back, there’s your life thing. If you ride a bus that allows you to work on your writing,
                            reading, knitting, etc. Then
                            there’s your side project time. So aside from budgeting, time management is also about smart
                            organizing.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5 post-subheading">The Pay</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/pay.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you a maximizer, or a don’t care as long as it gets me by kind of person? Either way,
                            this is a good time to
                            realistically assess your financial needs.</li>
                        <li>Look up average pay for the position you are going for. Use different sources to get a
                            better idea. Compare that
                            against the salary the employer offers.</li>
                        <li>Do the dreaded look back through your bank statement, just do it, like pulling off a
                            bandaid. Use a smart app like <a href="https://mint.com">mint</a> if you want. Get an idea
                            of how much money you spend monthly. Compare that against the salary the employer offers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure you consider how much you will be able to save after expenses. If you don’t think
                            you should be saving. I
                            think you might be wrong. But I don’t know much about saving, so let’s all read more about
                            what we don’t know okay?</li>
                        <li>I included this section last so you wouldn’t think about it until the end. It’s not that it
                            isn’t important, it is
                            just that it's often the only consideration. Remember, there are other currencies, other
                            ways to feel valued and other
                            ways to track productivity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="pt-5">Getting a job sometimes feels like a full-time job. But hey, if it helps, it’ll get
                        you trained for working long hours,
                        getting organized and becoming a better problem solver. Not to mention gaining valuable
                        knowledge of (your)self, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNkE-sgoqw8" target="#">great
                            song btw</a>. Don’t waste your time applying to jobs you will not be content with. Consider
                        all angles, this will be your
                        life for the next who knows how many years. Don’t be lazy about it, be selective and deliberate.
                    </p>

                    <p>When you pick the jobs you want and apply to them, don’t go to interviews feeling
                        under-practiced. Think back to those exams you showed up unprepared for, it is the worst
                        feeling. Prepare enough so that you are not only comfortable talking about everything on the job
                        posting but also intrigued to see how the employer will respond to your questions.</p>
