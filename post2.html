                            Not that I haven't said it before, I'm sure I have,
                            it is such a common human thing to want to organize
                            things into tidy easy to understand categories. But
                            I strongly vow to go against this inclination. This
                            limiting, restrictive mentality does no one any
                            good, and it is especially problematic in the world
                            of programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I read an article by a programmer claiming
                            to not be a certain type of programmer, by
                            describing another category of programmers and
                            labeling themselves as one. The article conveyed
                            that,<i>'it's okay to not love what you work on'</i
                            >. This new category of programmers as she puts it,
                            are the <i>'get it done programmers'</i>. Does this
                            make anyone else raise an eyebrow? I'm sure everyone
                            has had <i>'get it done'</i> moments in their life,
                            but to adopt this as a mantra seems pretty defeatist
                            to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm not discrediting the article altogether, it did
                            raise some important points about the differences in
                            people's problem-solving approaches, learning styles
                            and levels of expertise within technical teams. She
                            includes a few reasonable things for managers and
                            programming peers to consider including, for
                            managers to not assume programmers don't have other
                            passions and interests. Any article that talks about
                            recognizing diversity in work teams is not all bad,
                            in my opinion.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/tops.png" alt="" />
                        <p>
                            Another point I agree with the author on is that
                            there are confining societal expectations that
                            define what a programmer should be. The
                            preconception that there is no room for anything
                            else in your life that isn't a set of specific
                            activities. It is what you read, what you entertain
                            yourself with, what you write and that you naturally
                            excel in all of these. This is the pressure that
                            made me quit programming for years, making me feel
                            that I wasn't
                            <i>'born to program'</i>. That I'm
                            <i>'faking it, and never making it'</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now that I am back, and finally feel comfortable
                            doing what I do, it seems counterintuitive to create
                            more labels around what people in the industry are
                            like. This is why I disagree with people trying to
                            establish themselves as the new type of programmer.
                            In my opinion, the only way to move forward here is
                            to take a label-free approach with every person and
                            recognize them as humans with abilities,
                            limitations, and interests. Once we stop making
                            absolutist statements and generalizations, we will
                            really start to see that any set of skills is valid.
                            And moreover, that the opportunities to learn new
                            things and apply them in unconventional ways are
                            endless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Establishing yourself as any particular type
                            inevitably means that you can never be the other
                            kind. If I am _____ I can never say I am ______.
                            Bear with me while I throw a programming analogy at
                            you, but I couldn't help it. I'm borrowing this
                            example that is explained thoroughly by MPJ in this
                            <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA"

                            >. So TLDR: There's this problem with
                            object-oriented programming. Let's say you create a
                            hierarchy like so:
                        </p>
                        <div class="post-sublist">
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <div>Robot</div>
                                    <div class="ml-2">.drive()</div>
                                </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>CleaningRobot</div>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>MurderRobot</div>
                                        <div class="ml-2">.kill()</div>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <div>Animal</div>
                                    <div class="ml-2">.poop()</div>
                                </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>Cat</div>
                                        <div class="ml-2">.meow()</div>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <div>Dog</div>
                                        <div class="ml-2">.bark()</div>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            And then you are asked to create a cleaning, murder,
                            robot dog, who does not poop. Using OOP you would be
                            forced to do either of these non-optimal things:
                        </p>
                        <div class="post-sublist">
                            <ol>

                                    Create a parent object for all the shared

                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <p>So bottom line</p>
                        <div class="post-quote">
                            "Inheritance (OOP) is when you design your types
                            around what they are, and composition is when you
                            design types around what they do" -MPJ (<a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA"
                                >Fun Fun Function</a
                            >)
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            So a different approach using composition involves
                            defining functions: barker, cleaner, driver, pooper
                            and killer, and using those to merge them into new
                            objects that will represent whatever you want, say a
                            murder robot dog.

                        <p>
                            With this in mind, we can bring this concept back to
                            the programmer issue at hand. Instead of trying to
                            define who a programmer is, or trying to predict the
                            future of what your life will be like as a
                            programmer. Take a set of the skills that relate to
                            programming and create yourself as a new person with
                            abilities. When something else comes up that you
                            want to learn, see it as a new tool that you can add
                            to your toolbox, instead of trying to figure out if
                            that skill fits within the constructs of your type.

                            You spend a lot of your life at work. Having no
                            passion for what you do and settling for that
                            because other people do it will not bring you
                            happiness. Recognizing the things you do enjoy and
                            trying to find ways to improve the ones you don't
                            may. Take things case by case, no one permanently
                            loves or hates programming, I can assure you
                            everyone has had difficult times coding, and
                            everyone can have satisfying moments.

                            Finally, learning something you are not naturally
                            gifted in or something you find difficult is very
                            valuable. It makes your brain work in non-habitual
                            ways, it is a practice on humility and helps you
                            build endurance. More on doing what you are not good
